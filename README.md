## Changes to Makefile

Added to the inter: piece of the Makefile so that the correct output/inter_submission/root# directories as well as the output/final_submission directory match with what is expected.

## Individual Contributions: 

Ryan: Created a group github repository to collectively work out of and set up the project files and README document. Worked alongside group members to create and finalize leaf_process.c. Reorganized the Makefile to create the correct output/inter_submission/root# directories.

Marwa: Worked on leaf_process, specifically extracting root and file names and writing hash to new file. Helped group members debug and finalize leaf_process.c. 

Basma: 

## Plan for how you are going to construct the pipes and inter-process communication. (high-level pseudocode would be acceptable/preferred for this part)
